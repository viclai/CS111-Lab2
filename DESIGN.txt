Design Problem: Change Notification 

What It Does: 
  A process can request a notification of a part of the disk being written 
    to. The "-n" option does this. 
  This option supports notifications for a fourth of the disk specified by 
    the user. Since the disk has 32 sectors, the first fourth of the disk 
    consists of the first 8 sectors, the second fourth of the disk consists of 
    the next 8 sectors, and so on. For example, the command 
    "./osprdaccess -r 4 -n 2 &" receives a notification when the second 
    fourth of the disk has been written to. When it gets the notification, it 
    reads the first four bytes of the disk. The default value is 1 (if the 
    user doesn't specify a part of the disk). 
  The processes requesting for a notification must be run in the background 
    (or else it will hang). 

What's the Point? 
  This application can be related to a scoreboard (at a sporting event)! We 
    read the new score when we get notified that the score has changed. A 
    command like './osprdaccess -r 21 -n & echo "Bruins 46 Trojans 35" | 
    ./osprdaccess -w 21' may be analogous to that example. Each fourth of the 
    disk may possibly represent the score for a different game.
