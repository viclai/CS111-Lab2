Design Problem: Change Notification 

Preliminary Ideas: 
  Edit the main function (in "osprdaccess.c") so that a notification option 
    can be specified by the user (i.e. -n). 
  When the user specifies the notification option, we must somehow let the 
    kernel know that we're requesting notifications. For now, we can pass in 
    the "O_APPEND" flag into the 3rd argument of the "open" system call. 
  When "open" is called (in "osprdacess.c"), the code for the function 
    "osprd_open" (in "osprd.c") will be executed. We can check that the option 
    has been specified by looking to see if the flag has been set. 
  One of the member variables in "struct inode" will be able to tell the 
    process (that is requesting notifications) if the file opened has been 
    written to. That member variable provides the "last modified time". We 
    can just check to see if that time has changed. 
  Use "wait_event_interruptible" to block and let others in the queue run.
